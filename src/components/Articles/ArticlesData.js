      "'Healthy living' to most people means both physical and mental health are in balance or functioning well together in a person. In many instances, physical and mental health are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one directly affects the other. Consequently, some of the tips will include suggestions for emotional and mental 'healthy living.' \nTake a first Step a towards healthy lifestyle \nQuit Smoking \nSet a date for quitting. If possible, plan to have a friend quit smoking with you. It's best to pick a day within the next month. A date too far off in the future will give you a chance to procrastinate and postpone, while a date too soon may not allow you to make a plan for medications or support systems. \nNotice when and why you smoke. Try to find the things in your daily life that you often do while smoking such as drinking your morning cup of coffee or driving a car. \nChange your smoking routines: Keep your cigarettes in a different place. Smoke with your other hand. Don't do anything else when you are smoking. Think about how you feel when you smoke. \nAll humans have to eat food for growth and maintenance of a healthy body, but we humans have different nutrition requirements as infants, children, teenagers, young adults, adults, and seniors. For example, infants may require feeding every 4 hours until they gradually age and begin to take in more solid foods. Eventually they develop into the more normal pattern of eating three times per day as young kids. However, as most parents know, kids, teenagers, and young adults often snack between meals. \nHere are Some Tips to make your life a better living:- \n1. Eat three healthy meals a day like breakfast, lunch, and dinner it is important to remember that dinner does not have to be the largest meal.\n2. The bulk of food consumption should consist of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products.\n3. Incorporate lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts with emphasis on beans and nuts for a healthy diet.\n4. Choose foods that are low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt like sodium, and added sugars; look at the labels because the first listed items on the labels comprise the highest concentrations of ingredients.\n5. Control portion sizes:- eat the smallest portion that can satisfy hunger and then stop eating.\n6. Healthy snacks are OK in moderation and should consist of items like fruit, whole grains, or nuts to satisfy hunger and not cause excessive weight gain.\n7. Avoid eating a large meal before sleeping to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and weight gain.\n8. Avoid heavy meals in the summer months, especially during hot days.\n9. A vegetarian lifestyle has been promoted for a healthy lifestyle and weight loss; vegetarians should check with their physicians to be sure they are getting enough vitamins, minerals, and iron in their diet.\n10. Avoid eating raw or undercooked meats of any type.",

      "Physical activity and exercise is a major contributor to a healthy lifestyle;people are made to use their bodies, and disuse leads to unhealthy living. Unhealthy living may manifest itself in obesity, weakness, lack of endurance, and overall poor health that may foster disease development\n 1.	Regular exercise can prevent and reverse age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength, improve balance, flexibility, and endurance, and decrease the risk of falls in the elderly. Regular exercise can help prevent coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Regular, weight-bearing exercise can also help prevent osteoporosis by building bone strength.\n 2.	Regular fitness can help chronic arthritis sufferers improve their capacity to perform daily activities such as driving, climbing stairs, and opening jars.\n 3.Regular exercise can help increase self-esteem and self-confidence, decrease stress and anxiety, enhance mood, and improve general mental health.\n 4.Regular exercise can help control body weight and in some people cause loss of fat.\n 5.Thirty minutes of modest exercise (walking is OK) at least 3 to 5 days a week is recommended, but the greatest health benefits come from exercising most days of the week.\n 6.Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions.m\n 7.Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury or excessive soreness or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day.\n 8.People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance with exercise.\n9.Almost any type of exercise (resistance, water aerobics, walking, swimming, weights, yoga, and many others) is helpful for everybody.\n10.Children need exercise; play outside of the home is a good beginning.",

      "A balanced diet includes foods from five groups and fulfills all of a person’s nutritional needs. Eating a balanced diet helps people maintain good health and reduce their risk of disease.\nDietary guidelines evolve with scientific advances, so it can be challenging to stay on top of current recommendations and know what to eat.\nIn this article, we look at current dietary recommendations and describe how to build a balanced diet.\nWhat is a balanced diet?\n\nA balanced diet is one that fulfills all of a person’s nutritional needs. Humans need a certain amount of calories and nutrients to stay healthy.\nA balanced diet provides all the nutrients a person requires, without going over the recommended daily calorie intake.\nBy eating a balanced diet, people can get the nutrients and calories they need and avoid eating junk food, or food without nutritional value.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) used to recommend following a food pyramid. However, as nutritional science has changed, they now recommend eating foods from the five groups and building a balanced plate.\nAccording to the USDA’s recommendations, half of a person’s plate should consist of fruits and vegetables.\nThe other half should be made up of grains and protein. They recommend accompanying each meal with a serving of low-fat dairy or another source of the nutrients found in dairy. \nThe 5 food groups\nA healthful, balanced diet includes foods from these five groups:\nvegetables\n1.fruits\n2.grains\n3.protein\n4.dairy\n\nVegetables\nThe vegetable group includes five subgroups:\n1.leafy greens\n2.red or orange vegetables\n3.starchy vegetables\n4.beans and peas (legumes)\n5.other vegetables, such as eggplant or zucchini\nFruits\n-A balanced diet also includes plenty of fruit. Instead of getting fruit from juice, nutrition experts recommend eating whole fruits.\n-Juice contains fewer nutrients. Also, the manufacturing process often adds empty calories due to added sugar. People should opt for fresh or frozen fruits, or fruits canned in water instead of syrup.\nGrains\nThere are two subgroups: whole grains and refined grains.\n\nWhole grains include all three parts of the grain, which are the bran, germ, and endosperm. The body breaks down whole grains slowly, so they have less effect on a person’s blood sugar.\n\nAdditionally, whole grains tend to contain more fiber and protein than refined grains.\n\nRefined grains are processed and do not contain the three original components. Refined grains also tend to have less protein and fiber, and they can cause blood sugar spikes.\n\nGrains used to form the base of the government-approved food pyramid, meaning that most of a person’s daily caloric intake came from grains. However, the updated guidelines suggest that grains should make up only a quarter of a person’s plate.\n\nAt least half of the grains that a person eats daily should be whole grains. Healthful whole grains include:\n\n1.quinoa\n2.oats\n3.brown rice\n4.barley\n5.buckwheat\nProtein\n\n.The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that all people should include nutrient-dense protein as part of their regular diet.\n\nThe guidelines suggest that this protein should make up a quarter of a person’s plate.\n\nNutritious protein choices include:\n\n1.lean beef and pork\n2.chicken and turkey\n3.fish\n4.beans, peas, and legumes\nDairy\n\nDairy and fortified soy products are a vital source of calcium. The USDA recommend consuming low-fat versions whenever possible.\n\nLow-fat dairy and soy products include:\n\n1.ricotta or cottage cheese\n2.low-fat milk\n3.yogurt\n4.soy milk\nPeople who are lactose intolerant can opt for low-lactose or lactose-free products, or choose soy-based sources of calcium and other nutrients.",
